// From Reading :

// 1. What are alternatives to default parameters?
//  Ans : Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized
//        with default values if no value or undefined is passed.
//   For example let us see this code :
//         function multiply(a, b = 1) {
//           return a * b;
//      }
//    In this example we see that the default value for b = 1 ; if it is not passed a value


// 2. What are things you should consider while naming a function?
//     Ans : 
// When we naming a function it  :
// > should be a verb. 
// > It should be brief, as accurate as possible
// > it should describe what the function does, 
// > it shpuld easily be readable for othefr programers


// 3. Do functions need to be always commented? Write your understanding based on the reading.
//    Ans: 
//    As to my understanding , commenting a function is not a must , but it is best practice to be comment, 
//    The overall idea of commenting was for those reader or even the one who develop the code come back, may 
//    be after several years , it should defenitely difficult what the code is , if we are not commented well.
//    In short Commenting is used for mentaining the code.
